# catoper

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The `catoper` is a miscellany of functions useful to myself:

-   some statistical's test (one or two);

-   I don't know anymore... =D

## Installation

You can install the development version of catoper from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("denis-or/catoper")
```

## Example

``` r
catoper::see_normality(variable = rnorm(150), label = "Variavel")
```
