# catoper

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The `catoper` is a miscellany of functions useful to myself:

 - some statistical's test (one or two);
 
 - I don't know anymore... =D

## Installation

You can install the development version of catoper from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("denis-or/catoper")
```

## Example

No examples! =X
